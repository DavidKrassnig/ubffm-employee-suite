# University Library Frankfurt Employee Suite

This repository contains Python scripts that I use as an employee of the University Library Frankfurt. At the moment, it allows me to connect to the university's VPN, clock in and out as well as get my latest accumulated working hours.

To adapt for personal use, modify the last name and, if necessary, modify the path to CISCO AnyConnect to correspond to your local system.

## ToDo

- Expand functionality
    - Calculate time needed to reach the daily minimum and maximum
    - Mount network partitions
    - Time Corrections
    - Get working time values for specific dates
- Generalise usage
    - Create config file for values that need to be adjusted (username etc.)
