# University Library Frankfurt Employee Suite

**Notice:** This repository will no longer be updated as my _Bibliotheksreferendariat_ (something akin to an integrated degree program in Library and Information Science in Germany) at the University Library Frankfurt is drawing to a close and I'm moving on to another University library, I won't work any further on this. I'll keep the archive publcially available, however, in case anyone else wants to pick it up.

This repository contains Python scripts that I used as an employee of the University Library Frankfurt. It allowed me to connect to the university's VPN, clock in and out as well as get my latest accumulated working hours.

To adapt for personal use, modify the last name and, if necessary, modify the path to CISCO AnyConnect to correspond to your local system.

## ToDo (that I didn't get around to doing but should be fairly easy to implement)

- Expand functionality
    - Calculate time needed to reach the daily minimum and maximum
    - Mount network partitions
    - Time Corrections
    - Get working time values for specific dates
- Generalise usage
    - Create config file for values that need to be adjusted (username etc.)
